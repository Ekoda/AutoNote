 Okay Ellie, we're gonna have a small talk. What do you wish to say to me? I wish to say to you that I need to work. Wow, you need to work? Why? Because I need to make money, baby! You need to make money? You're telling me you're not rich? No, I'm telling you that I don't have a rich boyfriend that can pay for me. That's a shame. That makes me sad. You should work on that. I know. Maybe I am in the background. Smart.
